# Pretty pomodoro clock

This is a simple HTML, CSS and JS web "Pomodoro" clock with a more appealing look. 

* Open index.html in a browser to "run" the project.
* The `Start` button starts the clock. The "`pomodoro`" clock will start `turning` for 25 minutes.
* Once you have started the clock the button will change to `Reset`. If you click it, the clock will reset itself back to 25 minutes, stop, and the button will change to the initial state of `Start`.
* When the clock reaches 0 it stays there until someone clicks the `Reset` button.
